# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com)

He's much better at this than I am, so however
he wants me to edit the README doc (even what kind
of file extension it has) is fine by me. Cheers,
Michael. I hope this goes well.
